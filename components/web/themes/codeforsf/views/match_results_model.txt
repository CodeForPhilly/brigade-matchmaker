Model for the project matching wizard return data

success : Boolean
projects : array of objects
  [object[0], ...  ]
    id : string (name)
    score : Num
    skillScore: num
    interestsScore: num
    goalsScore: num
skills : array of strings user's selection
interests: array of strings user's selection
goals: array of strings user's selection

// If this model could also include the data from the project model for every matching project it will make the matching presentation simpler:

I.e.
projects : array of objects
  [object[0], ...  ]
    id : string (name)
    score : Num
    skillScore: num
    interestsScore: num
    goalsScore: num
  //  include the matching project Object:
    _id: string id
    name: string
    matchingConfig : single Object
      rolesNeeded : array of strings // I think this now should be called goals
      skillsNeeded: array of strings
      interestsNeeded: array of strings

  //This model needs to be extended to include:
    Team Leader
    Team Leader or Project email address
    Mission statement/project description
    Project url (or github?)
    Project graphic/photo
